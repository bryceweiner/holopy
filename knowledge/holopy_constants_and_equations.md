### Information Current Tensor Fundamental Form
```
J^μν = ∇^μ∇^νρ - γρ^μν

Where ρ is the information density scalar field and ρ^μν is the information distribution tensor.

### Modified Einstein Field Equations
```
G_μν + Λg_μν = (8πG/c⁴)T_μν + γ · 𝒦_μν

### Higher-Rank Information Tensor
```
J^αβ_μν = (1/2)(J^α_μJ^β_ν + J^α_νJ^β_μ - g_μνJ^αλJ^β_λ) + (R/6)(g^αβg_μν - δ^α_μδ^β_ν)

Where J^α_μ represents the normalized information current.

### Information-Mass Relationship
```
M(r) = 4π ∫_0^r (r'²/c²) · ℱ[J_00](r') dr'
```
Where ℱ[J_00] represents the information energy-momentum tensor component.

### Coherence Decay Equation
```
⟨x|ρ(t)|x'⟩ = ⟨x|ρ(0)|x'⟩ · exp(-γt|x-x'|²)
```
Describes how quantum coherence between spatial positions decays with time.

### Maximum Information Processing Rate
```
dI/dt_max = γ · (A/l_P²)
```
Where A is the area of a region of spacetime and l_P is the Planck length.

### Information Processing Constraint
```
𝒯(𝒮) ≤ γ · S_ent
```
Where 𝒯(𝒮) represents the transformation rate of quantum state 𝒮, and S_ent is its entanglement entropy.

## Physical Relations

### E8×E8 Heterotic Structure Properties
- The root system of E8 consists of 240 roots constructed as:
```
{±e_i ± e_j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 8} ∪ {(1/2)∑_{i=1}^8 ±e_i : even number of + signs}
```

### Minimal Root Rotation
- The minimum rotation angle in the E8×E8 root space: θ_min = π/120 radians

### Black Hole Information Processing
- Information is preserved during black hole evaporation but can only be processed at the rate limited by γ

### Decoherence Rate Scaling
- Decoherence rates scale inversely with the square of the system size: Rate ∝ L^-2

### Emergent Spacetime Metric
```
g_μν(x) = ∑_{i,j=1}^{496} (∂π^{-1}_i(x)/∂x^μ) κ_ij (∂π^{-1}_j(x)/∂x^ν)
```
Where π^{-1} is a local section of the projection from E8×E8 space to 4D spacetime, and κ_ij are components of the Killing form.
