# HoloPy Development Context

## Overview
HoloPy is a Python library for holographic cosmology and holographic gravity simulations, similar to AstroPy but focused on implementing holographic universe theory. The library is based on the E8×E8 heterotic structure framework which posits that physical reality emerges from information processing dynamics at the Planck scale.

## Core Principles
- **Information-theoretic foundation**: Reality is fundamentally composed of information processing, with physical laws emerging from information constraints
- **Holographic principle**: The information content of a volume of space can be encoded on its boundary
- **E8×E8 heterotic structure**: The underlying mathematical framework representing the fundamental information processing architecture of physical reality
- **Emergence**: Spacetime, gravity, and quantum phenomena emerge from information dynamics

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Follow a modular design similar to AstroPy
- Prioritize clean, well-documented, and tested code
- Maintain Python best practices (PEP 8) and scientific computing conventions
- Use numpy, scipy, and other scientific Python libraries
- Implement rigorous error handling and logging
- Support common scientific workflows

### Implementation Priorities
1. Core constants and fundamental parameters
2. E8×E8 root system and lattice representation
3. Information current tensor calculations
4. Quantum decoherence modelling
5. Holographic gravity simulations
6. Visualization tools for higher-dimensional structures
7. Testing frameworks against known physical predictions

### Mathematical Rigor
- All implementations must precisely match the mathematical formulations
- Numerical stability should be prioritized, especially for high-dimensional calculations
- Approximation methods should be clearly documented with error bounds

### Physical Motivation
- All implementations must precisely match the physical motivations relevant to the context.
- Numerical stability should be prioritized, especially for high-dimensional calculations
- Approximation methods should *never* be used.
